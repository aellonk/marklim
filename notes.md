1. Add new images to index.html at end. 
2. Check class names to match files positions, and use correct IDs.
3. Update style.css with new images' filenames. Add mobile versions in media queries. White placeholder images do not have their images in IDs (they use white-left and white-right classes)
4. Update scripts.js to adjust initial slide.
5. Move previous batch of images (story) to beginning of slider html for correct order of prev & next buttons in infinite scroll.
6. Adjust slickGoTo numbers for correct click through (every two images) 
7. Check back and forward buttons and clicking on images to make sure clicking through goes to correct images.
